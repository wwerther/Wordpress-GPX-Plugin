A plugin that generates nice charts from GPX-files. It put's all information about heartrate, cadence, elevation and speed into one chart. 

## Description ##

This plugin generates charts from GPX-files. The file will be processed in real-time, no intermediate data is written to the database or the wp-content directory. Currently the plugin is tested with GPX-Files generated by a Garmin-Device.
The TRK-Section is parsed and information about your heartrate, your cadence and the current speed is calculated. Since GPX-files can contain a lot of data-points they can be reduced to a certain amount to guarantee, that the rendering time of the chart won't consume to much time in your browser.
You can hover with the mouse over the generated chart to get detailed information about the currently selected time-instance. You can also turn off graphs that where currently shown. Every graph get its own Y-axis and color.
You can also zoom into the graph to get more details.

Current development supports [Flot](http://code.google.com/p/flot/) instead of Highcharts. It is released under [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) and will be therefore more compatible to GPL.

Up to version 0.1.5 [Highcharts-API](http://www.highcharts.com/) is the only available rendering engine. Please respect their license and pricing (only Free for Non-Commercial usage).

Beginning with 0.2.0 both rendering engines are present. Support for Highcharts is not fully available any more and will be further reduced. If you still need it (because you don't want to switch to FLOT) please let me know.

This plugin also might work with older Wordpress-Releases (3.1.x), but it depends at least on PHP v5. Please let me know if you experience problems with this. 

## Installation ##

1. Download the Plugin ZIP file
1. Unpack the Plugin-ZIP
1. Upload the gpx2chart folder to your wordpress plugin directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

After activating the plugin you can use GPX2Chart with these shortcode:

* \[gpx2chart href="\<GPX-File\>" \]

Optional parameters are
gpx2chart href="<GPX-Source>" (maxelem="51") (debug) (width="90%") (metadata="heartrate cadence distance speed") (display="heartrate cadence elevation speed")

* maxelem="\<maxelem\>"
* width	\-\> The width of the main-container. Can be specified in px or %. Will be directly put into the element-style;
* color\_(heartrate|cadence|elevation|speed) = ('#AA4643', '#4572A7', '#89A54E', '#CACA00' )
* title\_(heartrate|cadence|elevation|speed)
* display="heartrate cadence elevation speed"
* dashstyle\_(heartrate|cadence|elevation|speed) = (Solid, ShortDash, ShortDot, ShortDashDot, ShortDashDotDot, Dot, Dash, LongDash, DashDot, LongDashDot, LongDashDotDot) defaults to solid, except heartrate=shortdot
* seriestype\_(heartrate|cadence|elevation|speed) = (area, areaspline, bar, column, line, pie, scatter, spline) defaults to spline, except for elevation=areaspline
* render = (flot,highcharts) default is flot
* debug \-\> If this is present the PHP-module put some more information into the HTML-file

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Where do I get the development-version? ###

There are several ways. You can download it from (http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/gpx2chart/trunk/) or use the prepacked version from Wordpress when selecting "other versions" => development version. This will represent a more or less stable release.
If you really want to use the bleeding-edge you need to download from [GitHub](https://github.com/wwerther/Wordpress-GPX-Plugin). My primary development is done on this plattform. I've also added a scripts to update the subversion-directory on wordpress.
So the different steps are: local copy on my computer \-\> github \-\> wordpress-svn trunk \-\> wordpress-svn tag
tagged versions on github have the same code-base like wordpress tags.

### How can I help you? ###

I know that there are still some bugs in this plugin. Since I only have limited possibilities to test with different browser etc. So please let me know if you find a bug. Normally I try to fix them very soon. Thanks to Michael for all tests he is doing...

* The legend on the x-axis disappear sometimes when selecting/deselecting single-graphs

### Is there a Roadmap? ###

Yes, there is kind of a roadmap. But the order depends on my time.

* Write a better documentation
* Make the graphs more customizable
* Include CSS to change layout of the summary, that is currently displayed below the graph
* Include a Link to the OSM-module so the Lon/Lat-Information is shown on the map, when hovering over the chart.
* Include some more error-detection (e.g. File-Not-Found) and change the output then.

### Can I add my own rendering engine ###

Yes, of course! I would really appreciate this. But I'm very sorry to tell, that the interfaces for additional rendering plugins are not finalized yet. They are also not really well documented. Please get in contact with me if you plan to add your own rendering engine. 

## Screenshots ##

1. ![Graph1][screenshot1] A graph displaying the heartrate, the elevation and the speed of one track
2. ![Graph2][screenshot2] The Tool-Tip when hovering over the chart shows even more information (time since start, distance since start)
3. ![Graph3][screenshot3] By clicking on the legend you can deactivate one or graph

## Changelog ##
